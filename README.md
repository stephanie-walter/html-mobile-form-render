html-mobile-form-render
=======================

A little project to put together the form render of HTML elements on different mobile and tablets and to see what the nativ control looks like when it is focused.

The idea is not only to see if the form element is supported and the render of the element, but to see how the nativ control looks when the field it is focused( eg. keyboard changes for email, search, nativ select lists, etc.). That’s actually why we need you to do the screenshots with the field focused (and can’t use online testing tools)
