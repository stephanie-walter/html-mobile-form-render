html-mobile-form-render
=======================

A little project to put together the form render of HTML elements on different mobile and tablets and to see what the nativ control looks like when it is focused.

The idea is not only to see if the form element is supported and the render of the element, but to see how the nativ control looks when the field it is focused( eg. keyboard changes for email, search, nativ select lists, etc.). That’s actually why we need you to do the screenshots with the field focused (and can’t use online testing tools)

Ho to help ? 
=======================
If you want to help to create this little gallerie of screenshots, you just have to <a href="http://soqr.fr/form-elements/">check this form elements page and take some screenshots</a>from your mobile / tablet. We need you to *make a screenshot of each field with the focus on it* (except radio/checkbox and range) so that we can gather as many information as possible on the native controls of each browser + OS.

Then you just have to create the page for the element (or fork an existing one). You can also use <a href="http://www.inpixelitrust.fr/me-contacter/">my contact information here </a>to send me the screenshots and I'll do the boring work of putting them together.
